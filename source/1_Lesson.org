- In this project, you will design and create your own high-power LED light.
- Everything will be completely original, designed by you.
- You will need to combine your SolidWorks skills, circuit design, soldering and making abilities to produce a product which will potentially last for many years to come.

- Since the dawn of time, people have benefitted from being able to see after the sun goes down. 
- Wood fires gave way to oil lamps. The early 1800's saw the introduction of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_lighting][gas street lights]]. The latter half of the 19th century saw the invention of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb][filament bulb]] powered by electricity.
- More recently, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode][LED]] lighting is becoming more popular.

[[./img/1w_led.jpg]]
- Your light will use 2x 1W LEDs (shown above magified - they're about 3mm X 10mm x 10mm)
- The housing must be made from a combination of laser-cut 3mm MDF and 3mm translucent acrylic.
- To emphasise the compact nature of LED lighting, your unit should be as small as possible.
  - It's dimensions must not exceed 35mm X 80mm X 80mm (H x W x D)
- The circuit must be built on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripboard][Stripboard]].
- It should run from a 9V battery, and include a switch to turn the power on and off.

- Sketch three ideas for the design of your housing. You can always make changes later, so don't fixate on details. This is about articulating your ideas!
  - /Silver:/ Three designs drawn.
  - /Gold:/ Includes an indication of dimensions.
  - /Platinum:/ Includes colour/type of materials and specifies techniques (e.g. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_joint][finger joints]], type of glue) for making.
