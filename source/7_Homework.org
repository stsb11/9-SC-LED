- "Nails can be used to join two pieces of wood together by driving them from one piece of wood into the other with a hammer. 
- The advantage of using nails is the speed with which the materials can be joined together.
- A disadvantage of nails is that the wood can split, and that it is easy to hit the wood by accident, marking the surface”
